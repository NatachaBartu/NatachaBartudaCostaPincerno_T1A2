        <p>
          Hello!!! Welcome to my portfolio site! My name is Natacha Bartu
          and I'm currently a student at Coder Academy working towards my
          Diploma of Information Technology on my way to becoming a full
          stack web developer.<br />
          I have a beautiful and lovely family! A son of 3 year old, he has
          a lot's of energy and passionate about cars, a beautiful husband
          which supports me a lot throught the course and also I have a
          stunning dog, my old baby golden retriver. We love spend time
          together outside when we can.<br />
          I'm fascinating about this world of tech! and have been learning a
          lot about skills of developer, and focus to learn more and more
          throught my career.<br />

      <h1>My Interests</h1>
      <p>
        I am a very organised person, wich most include more my home
        organisation. I quite like labels things around the house and
        cleaning all the stuff<br />
        I love food as well! Enjoy cooking as much as possible at home. I
        really enjoy to have my friends around and cook for them,
        as a good brazillian family we like to spend time together doing
        our bbq.<br />
        As a dedicated mother I really like to spend good quality time
        with my son. When usually keen on doing something outdoor,
        rather then indoor activities, our favourite activitie is pic nic
        at the park.<br />
        And finally, I like a quiet time too, wich is to watch a good movie
        at my cinema home with a bucket of popping corn is perfect to close
        my weekend.
